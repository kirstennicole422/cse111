            Time Spent
   Date       (hours)   Description of Work
----------  ----------  -------------------------
2024-02-14      1.0     Final testing/modifications with running and test functions
2024-02-14      0.5     Made sure functions connected to each other and all
                        were used
2024-02-14      0.5     Tested unit conversion function and modified
2024-02-14      1.0     Modified unit conversion to take compound list of units
2024-02-14      1.0     Discussed how to implement unit conversion function. 
                        Decided on passing in a list and using conditional 
                        statements
2024-02-13      0.25    Learned more about .zip() to iterate through lists        
2024-02-13      1.5     Adding units to csv and reading into 2 compound lists
                        (way more complicated than I expected)
2024-02-13      0.5     Changing program to use list
2024-02-13      0.5     Created/imported/read CSV to list
2024-02-13      1.0     Added unit conversion function
2024-02-13      0.25    More test functions
2024-02-13      0.25    Learned how to check if string can be converted to 
                        float with try/except and implemented
2024-02-10      0.25    Discussing program with classmate- what would be most
                        user-friendly:
2024-02-10      0.5     Writing test functions
2024-02-10      1.0     Testing functions and fixing return issues
2024-02-10      1.0     Creating/defining functions that determine which 
                        variable is missing and solve for it
2024-02-08      1.0     Refresher on the physics equations I am planning to use
2024-02-08      0.5     Converting formulas and rough outline of functions
